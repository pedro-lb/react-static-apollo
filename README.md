# React Static Apollo GraphQL Test

In this test we'll try to render dynamic (non-static) content in a static page generated by `react-static`.

This dynamic content will be a pok√©mon list, rendered using Apollo & GraphQL.

To run this project you can use `yarn start` or `npm run start` and access the `/dynamic` route. =)
